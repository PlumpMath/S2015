# Ch.1: Overview
## What is an OS?  What is a kernel?
  An operating system, or OS, is a program responsible for managing the hardware of a system
  making it convenient for the user(s) to use applications without having to concern themselves
  with hardware level issues. The kernel is the core of the operating system that is *always*
  running. This distinction is made against things like the Unix toolchain, which is considered
  part of the operating system, but is only executed when the user chooses so.
## Computer system organization and architecture

    to use every buffer element

  - pseudocode version of test-and-set, compare-and-swap atomic ops

## Mutex locks using spinlocks
  - acquire() and release()

## Semaphores
  - wait()/signal() (or P()/V())
  - both counting semaphores, and mutexes through binary semaphores
  - semaphore implementation with no busy waits: using block() and wakeup()

## Deadlock and starvation
  - should be able to give examples
  - some (possibly unrealistic) solutions to deadlock

## Classic problems of synchronization:
  - Bounded-buffer problem, solution w/semaphores
